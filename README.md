# Forbes2000_Scraper

**Genesis:**
I was at work in summer of 2016 (maybe my memory is foggy) when I overheard a coworker saying *"I guess I better get cracking filling in this excel."*  It wasn't an uncommon thing to hear working in finance, but hearing that in conjunction with the Salesforce admin saying *"I'm sorry bro, I couldn't solve it."* piqued my interest.

**Problem:**
We needed to gather demographic data on the Forbes top 2000.  We didn't have access to any Forbes API, just a list of websites.

**Solution:**
Having recently completed [GoogleMapsPython](https://github.com/Andreas237/GoogleMapsPython) I figured myself a Python god who could get the job done. (Side note: [GoogleMapsPython](https://github.com/Andreas237/GoogleMapsPython) was intended to get me a job, but I failed in that quest.  Feedback is welcome silenta237@gmail.com)  One night, minor wrangling of snakes, and we had the data!


**Use:**
1) Download the forbes_strip.py and a list of URL (.csv)

2) Run forbes_strip.py

3) Enjoy the free data!
